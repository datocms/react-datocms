# react-datocms Examples

This is an example application demonstrating the usage of `react-datocms` library.

This project uses [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces) to link to the parent `react-datocms` package.

## Local Development

From the **repository root**, run:

```bash
npm install         # Installs dependencies for both root and examples
npm run build       # Builds the react-datocms library
cd examples
npm start           # Runs the example app
```

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Deploy with Local/Unreleased Changes (from repository root)

Use this to showcase features that haven't been published to npm yet.

**Netlify/Vercel Configuration:**
- **Base directory:** (leave empty / root)
- **Build command:** `npm run build:examples`
- **Publish directory:** `examples/build`

This builds the local version of `react-datocms` and uses it in the examples.

### Option 2: Deploy with Published npm Version (from examples folder only)

Use this to showcase the latest published version from npm.

**Netlify/Vercel Configuration:**
- **Base directory:** `examples`
- **Build command:** `npm install && npm run build`
- **Publish directory:** `build`

This installs `react-datocms` from the npm registry and uses it in the examples.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
