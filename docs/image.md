# Image components for progressive/responsive images

`<SRCImage />` and `<Image />` are React components specifically designed to work flawlessly with DatoCMS's [`responsiveImage` GraphQL query](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-delivery-api/uploads#responsive-images) which optimizes image loading for your websites.

- TypeScript ready;
- CSS-in-JS ready;
- Usable both client and server side;
- Compatible with vanilla React, Next.js and pretty much any other React-based solution;

## Out-of-the-box features

- Offers optimized version of images for browsers that support WebP/AVIF format
- Generates multiple smaller images so smartphones and tablets don’t download desktop-sized images
- Efficiently lazy loads images to speed initial page load and save bandwidth
- Holds the image position so your page doesn’t jump while images load
- Uses either blur-up or background color techniques to show a preview of the image while it loads

## `<SRCImage />` vs `<Image />`

Even though their purpose is the same, there are some significant differences between these two components. Depending on your specific needs, you can choose to use one or the other:

* `<SRCImage />` is a [React Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components), so it can be rendered and optionally cached on the server. It doesn't create any JS footprint. It generates a single `<picture />` element and implements lazy-loading using the native [`loading="lazy"` attribute](https://web.dev/articles/browser-level-image-lazy-loading). The placeholder is set as the background to the image itself. Be careful: the placeholder is not removed when the image loads, so it's not recommended to use this component if you anticipate that the image may have an alpha channel with transparencies.
* `<Image />` is a [Client Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components). Since it runs on the browser, it has the ability to set a cross-fade effect between the placeholder and the original image, but at the cost of generating more complex HTML output composed of multiple elements around the main `<picture />` element. It also implements lazy-loading through `IntersectionObserver`, which allows customization of the thresholds at which lazy loading occurs.


## Usage

1. Import `Image` or `SRCImage` from `react-datocms` and use it in place of a regular `<img />` tag
2. Write a GraphQL query to your DatoCMS project using the [`responsiveImage` query](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-delivery-api/images-and-videos#responsive-images)

The GraphQL query returns multiple thumbnails with optimized compression. The image components automatically set up the “blur-up” effect as well as lazy loading of images further down the screen.

## Example

For a fully working example take a look at our [examples directory](https://github.com/datocms/react-datocms/tree/master/examples).

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Image, SRCImage } from 'react-datocms';

const Page = ({ data }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{data.blogPost.title}</h1>
    {/* uses native loading="lazy" */}
    <SRCImage data={data.blogPost.cover.responsiveImage} />
    {/* custom lazy-loading via IntersectionObserver */}
    <Image data={data.blogPost.cover.responsiveImage} />
  </div>
);

const query = gql`
  query {
    blogPost {
      title
      cover {
        responsiveImage(
          imgixParams: { fit: crop, w: 300, h: 300, auto: format }
        ) {
          # always required
          src
          srcSet
          width
          height

          # not required, but strongly suggested!
          alt
          title

          # blur-up placeholder, JPEG format, base64-encoded, or...
          base64
          # background color placeholder
          bgColor

          # you can omit `sizes` if you explicitly pass the `sizes` prop to the image component
          sizes
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;

export default withQuery(query)(Page);
```

### The `ResponsiveImage` object

The `data` prop of both components expects an object with the same shape as the one returned by `responsiveImage` GraphQL call. It's up to you to make a GraphQL query that will return the properties you need for a specific use of the `<Image>` component.

- The minimum required properties for `data` are: `src`, `width` and `height`;
- `alt` and `title`, while not mandatory, are all highly suggested, so remember to use them!
- If you don't request `srcSet`, the component will auto-generate an `srcset` based on `src` + the `srcSetCandidates` prop (it can help reducing the GraphQL response size drammatically when many images are returned);
- We strongly to suggest to always specify [`{ auto: format }`](https://docs.imgix.com/apis/rendering/auto/auto#format) in your `imgixParams`, instead of requesting `webpSrcSet`, so that you can also take advantage of more performant optimizations (AVIF), without increasing GraphQL response size;
- If you request both the `bgColor` and `base64` property, the latter will take precedence, so just avoid querying both fields at the same time, as it will only make the GraphQL response bigger :wink:;
- You can avoid requesting `sizes` and directly pass a `sizes` prop to the component to reduce the GraphQL response size;

Here's a complete recap of what `responsiveImage` offers:

### Layout mode

With the `layout` property, you can configure the behavior of the image as the viewport changes size:

- When `intrinsic` (default behaviour), the image will scale the dimensions down for smaller viewports, but maintain the original dimensions for larger viewports.
- When `fixed`, the image dimensions will not change as the viewport changes (no responsiveness) similar to the native `img` element.
- When `responsive`, the image will scale the dimensions down for smaller viewports and scale up for larger viewports.
- When `fill`, the image will stretch both width and height to the dimensions of the parent element, provided the parent element is relative.
  - This is usually paired with the `objectFit` and `objectPosition` properties.
  - Ensure the parent element has `position: relative` in their stylesheet.

Example for `layout="fill"` (useful also for background images):

```jsx
<div style={{ position: 'relative', width: 200, height: 500 }}>
  <Image
    data={imageData}
    layout="fill"
    objectFit="cover"
    objectPosition="50% 50%"
  />
</div>
```

### Changing `data`

If the `data` prop changes over time, this component works like a regular `<img />` in a browser: the new image won't appear until it loads, while the old image stays visible. If you want the old image to disappear while loading, you can use a `key=` so that React sees the changing image as a new `<img />` instead of just changing the src attribute:

```jsx
<Image
  key={imageData.src}
  data={imageData}
/>
```
